## 🎤 Presentation Outline

### 1. Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is **DvChege**, representing the **GTRs Testers** team.  
This video covers **Phase 3 of our Bookstore Application testing**, where we performed final test execution, defect reporting, and a comprehensive summary of results.

### 2. Testing Objective
Our main objective was to verify the end-to-end functionality of the Bookstore App — from browsing books, adding to cart, to completing checkout — ensuring that all workflows operate as expected and meet user requirements.

---

### 3. Test Execution & Evidence
We executed 25 test cases focusing on:
- Book Listing and Details  
- Cart operations  
- Checkout process  
Screenshots were captured to provide visual evidence of each module in action.  
For example, the **Cart Page** showed subtotal calculations, and the **Checkout Page** demonstrated input form validation.

### 4. Defect Reporting
We recorded 3 key defects:
- Missing validation on required fields (High severity)  
- Subtotal delay after removing items (Medium severity)  
- Quantity field accepting letters (Low severity, later resolved)

Each issue was prioritized, reported, and assigned to the respective developer for resolution.

### 5. Summary & Analysis
Out of 25 test cases:
- **22 passed** successfully  
- **3 failed** initially but are under review  
Overall, the app achieved **90% test coverage**, showing reliable performance with a few areas for improvement.

### 6. Conclusion
The Bookstore Application is functionally stable and ready for user acceptance testing after minor fixes.  
We recommend automating future regression tests and improving form validations.
